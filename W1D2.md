### W1D2:

**first steps to new program:**

 * set up new folder
 * git init
 * establish new repo and push before starting project

tip: create markdown files in code editor with extension .md

**live coding project**

write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments - that goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number - skip it. Do support negative numbers though.

*need to use process.argv for command line input*

```  
var numbers = process.argv.slice(2);
console.log(numbers);
```
the .slice is the number of items to remove from the beginning of the array. The variable is assigning the value from the left to the right. process.argv is an object (curly brackets represent an objet {}). Slice can only be called on an array.

```
function sumNumbers(nums) {
  console.log('In split array: ', nums);
}

sumNumbers(numbers); 

```
This function takes an array of numbers and returns a sum of the numbers as an integer. Functions should be **verb** type names as they are actions.

```
function sumNumbers(nums) {
  console.log('In split array: ', nums);
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    var num = nums[i]; 
    sum += num;
  }
  return(sum);
}

var output = sumNumbers(numbers);

console.log(output);
```
we started var sum at 0 as if it was blank, you could not add 1 etc. as it is NaN

this code will concatonate the strings, because we have not made them into an integer yet. So we need to call Number() on it.

```
function sumNumbers(nums) {
  console.log('In split array: ', nums);
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    var num = Number(nums[i]);
    sum += num;
  }
  return(sum);
}
```
**debugger breakpoint:**
 * in command line call node debug filename.js
 * break out with cntrl c
 * run **help** for commands
 *
